            <h2>The City of Sitka Alaska</h2>
            <p>
                The population of Sitka was 8,458 people according to the 2020 census, which makes it the fifth most populated city in Alaska. The total area (including water) is 4,811 square miles, making Sitka the largest city in the U.S. by total area. However, the developed land area is small.
            </p>
            <p>
                Being on an island, there is no interstate highway system. The longest stretch of road is Halibut Point Road and Sawmill Creek Road which connect together at a traffic circle. This stretches a total of approximately 14 miles with a maximum speed of 45 mph. But, most of this stretch is not developed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Downtown Sitka provides shopping, eating, and entertainment within a reasonable walking area.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Sitka Rocky Gutierrez Airport is bounded by water on both ends. Besides the airport, Japonski Island is also home to the U.S. Coast Guard, Mt. Edgecombe Medical Center, and Guardian Flight Air Ambulance.
