        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>As a teenager, my wife lived in Alaska with her mother and sister. They lived in various places around south-east Alaska. Sitka was where they lived the longest.</p>
        <p>In 2021, my wife decided it was time for us to visit Alaska. She woke me up late one night to tell me that airline tickets to Sitka were on sale. We purchased the tickets and told her sister about our find. Her sister also purchased tickets for her and her husband.</p>
        <p>We made arrangments to stay with friends in Sitka. While my wife's sister planned to stay the whole time in Sitka, my wife and I decided to also visit Juneau. We ferried to Juneau, stayed several days with other friends, and flew back to Sitka.</p>
        <p>Later that year, my wife's sister heard that an opening was coming up in the Fortress of the Bear gift shop and doing their books. She convinced her husband to move, sold their home, and moved.</p>
        <p>My wife and her sister are very close. My wife now goes to Sitka for 3 to 6 weeks at a time, twice a year. She also helps in the Fortress of the Bear gift shop while she is there, and explores her old stomping grounds.</p>
        <p>This year, my youngest daughter and her husband also went to Sitka to work the gift shop, the tourist excursions, and explore Sitka.</p>
        <p>While I have only been to Sitka one time, so far, it holds a special place in my heart. I'm excited to share with you, through this project, some of the sites of that beautiful city.</p>
