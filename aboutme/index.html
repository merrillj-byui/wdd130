    <h2>Joe</h2>
    <p>I'm old.</p>
    <p>I was born in California in the late 1960s. I remember watching the
        moon landing on our black and white TV. I grew up riding BMX bikes in our fields, shooting BB guns, catching
        crawdads, watching TV.
    </p>
    <p>As a scout, we did a visit to a site where one of our leaders worked. It was a computer installation for his
        company. The CPUs were multiple towers. There were separate towers for tape readers. They had an early disk
        system with disks that had to be moved by fork lift because they were so large. Input was by punch card. That
        visit started my interest in computers. I took some computer classes in high school. I started out on the TRS-80 
        with cassette tapes, then floppy disks the next year. Our family eventually purchased an Apple, and then upgraded
        to an Apple II with a CP/M card. I learned Wordstar, Apple Works, UCSD Pascal, and Basic on that computer. After 
        my mission I learned how to build a personal computer, and helped my father build one for the family. I started 
        college. But illness, family, and work all took over my time. I dropped school as my career took off.
    </p>
    <p>My wife and I have 5 children and 2 grandchildren. Two more grandchildren are on the way, with my middle
        daughter expecting twins in August. Our children were raised in Silicon Valley and Utah. 
    </p>
    <p>My career has been fascinating. I've grown up through the advent of personal home computers, network computering,
        network servers, multiple networking technologies, operating systems, the introduction of the web, and cloud
        computing. But, in all of that, my formal education has been my one regret. I am grateful to return to my
        formal education through BYU Pathway. I am excited to learn all that my broad exposure has missed in learning
        the details of the technologies that I use daily. 
    </p>
    <p>My earliest memories include the first moon landing. It is fitting that, as I finally seek to fill that gaping
        void in my education, humanity is working to visit the moon again. This is cool!
